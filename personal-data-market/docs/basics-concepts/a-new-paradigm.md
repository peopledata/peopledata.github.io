# A New Paradigm 
Peopledata is a new paradigm on retrive and develop personal data assets. 

## What PeopleData

PeopleData is on a mission to create a next generation personal data market infrastructures, across China and around the world; in which all market participant can retrieve and develop the value of personal data through equal access to secure and sovereign data sharing among trusted partners. 

## Why PeopleData

In last few decades, numerous App services are all-encompassing, covering almost all aspects of a personal life, work and study. Individuals move in the digital space created by these application services, and naturally and easily generate a large amount of personal data. These data from different data birthplaces, massive and heterogeneous data, constitute the individual Data space.

 
The old paradigm of personal data exploitation and utilization is that app service providers provide services to individuals, and individuals provide or produce personal data to app service providers. App service providers obtain direct or indirect benefits by processing and trading personal data.

 
This paradigm has undoubtedly dominated the development of the Internet over the past few decades. The core drivers of the paradigm shift are increased awareness of data rights and public and government concerns about privacy protection and security. Under the old paradigm, individuals' governance, control, and perception of their personal data space are very lacking.

​
Since the EU's introduction of GDPR in 2016, countries have accelerated their legislative agendas around personal data protection. With the promulgation of important laws and regulations such as the Personal Information Protection Law and the Data Security Law in my country, it marks the transformation of the development and utilization of personal data from an old paradigm to a new paradigm.

​
The new paradigm is in the process of forming and developing, and there is no global consensus yet. The EU proposes the mydata paradigm of “people-centred development and utilization of personal data”. The United States has not yet introduced a specific personal data protection law similar to GDPR. At present, most states have established legal systems based on consumer protection, and only a few states have introduced laws. In a nutshell, the United States advocates the open data paradigm "based on rules, protocols and markets". Other countries are also actively exploring new paradigms suitable for the development and utilization of personal data in their own countries based on their own legal, cultural and digital infrastructure conditions.


A paradigm shift in the exploitation and utilization of personal data is underway. we think that a core principle followed by the new paradigm is: The exploitation and utilization of personal data should always take into account openness, privacy and security, and in the dilemma formed between the three sectors, seek optimal solution for different contexts.

## How Peopledata
