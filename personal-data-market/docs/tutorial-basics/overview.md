# Functional Overview

The key functional areas addressed in this project are:

1. **Data agreement handling in DID/SSI**: The DA component will be an component that can be deployed into any DPIA tooling or any data exchange service. Any DID/SSI based data exchange solution could use this component to bring in legitimacy from a GDPR or PIPL perpective .

2. **Human-readble presentation and data agreement sign off**: To plugin data agreements to the existing presentation of any data schema in a comprehensive and reDAble form to the individual with a mobile app reference implementation.

3. **Delegation/guardianship data exchange**: To introduce mechanisms to support delegation/guardianship required for providing consent / delegated data agreements.

Legal and privacy experts will ensure compliance as to what data is required to be shared and the decision process (tree) to identify the attributes required to be in a verifiable credential. The DA project will collaborate closely with Aries, Trust over IP (ToIP), Kantara, DIF, MyData, peopledata, openddata, W3C and ISO.

The DA component will have the following deployement features:

- It will incorporate the outcome from a DPIA and can be used by all eDID/SSIF-Lab participants who wish to reduce legal liability during an DID/SSI-enabled data exchange.
- The component is privacy-by-design and provides automated tooling for organisations, taking care of the entire data agreement lifecycle.
- Goes beyond technology: Presentation of agreements and forms beyond a schema, providing enhanced end user experience and trust with standardised agreement presentation and handling, making DID/SSI technology adoptable by organisations and consumable by individuals without adversely impacting the user experience.
