# Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) 
A Data Protection Impact Assessment is a process to help an organisation identify and minimise the data protection risks involved in the use of personal data. It ensures that an organisation is compliant to data regulations.

In EU, Article 35 of the GDPR requires organisations to conduct DPIAs, especially when the processing is likely to result in high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons such as in the case when processing involves using new technologies and is extensive as well as when especially sensitive categories of personal data are being processed (e.g. health-related data). Organisations can also conduct DPIAs voluntarily, even if the processing does not meet the criteria set out in the GDPR. Some EU Member State data protection authorities, such as the Finnish data protection ombudsman, have recommended using dataflow maps when conducting DPIAs. Dataflow maps visualize the flows of personal data across systems, organisations, and jurisdictions, which provide an overview of the nature and scope of the processing and identify risks.

In China, Article [] of the PIPL require organisations to conduct DPIAs.
