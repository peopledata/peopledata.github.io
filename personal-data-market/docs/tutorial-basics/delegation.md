# Delegation/Guardianship data exchange

Following are the delegation scenarios which we intend to address as part of the project  including delegated consents and transfer of data control: 

* Delegated consent: 
  * For children under a certain age at any time and any situation, consent is delegated to their parents or guardians. 
  * For the elderly or incapacitated, on site, on demand, or during an emergency scenario, such as an accident, consent is delegated to anyone with power of attorney

* Transfer of data control:
  * Temporary transfer of control of an IoT device data, for example, during a rental, or valet parking service.
