# Data Exchange

This section explains the regulatory, privacy-related assessment and commitment to the individual (data subject) which will help understand the actors involved and the relationships between them.

The following sections introduce two different sets of relationships between organisations, depending on their roles in the personal data usage scenarios. In the first, both organisations are data controllers, albeit with different roles. In the other, only the data controller has an agreement with the individual and executes separate agreements with the data processors and sub-processors. The two perspectives determine the relationship between the various organisation roles and whether they should be subject to a data using agreement or a data processing agreement.

## 1. Agreement between two organisations


In this case, both organisations share the role as data controller and are responsible for managing their compliance requirements as such. They may have made their own privacy risk assessment, documented in a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) report, and concluded whether any additional mitigation effort was required.

In order for the two organisations to perform a data exchange we introduce a new term, a data using agreement, which, although not yet standardised, captures the understanding between two companies on how data is shared and what obligation each party has and that can be realised as a contract or in terms of use.

The individual (data subject) is engaged with both organisations and for each there is a standard data agreement and associated privacy policy that explains the purpose of processing personal data, what personal data is collected, data subject rights, etc.


## 2. Agreement between an organisation and their suppliers






In this view, there is a vertical relationship between a data controller and suppliers in the form of data processors and data sub-processors. For a higher level of accountability between these businesses a data processing agreement is set up, which lays out what routines are required to be in place: for example, data processorâ€™s obligations in case of data breaches or how rights of the data subject, such as access rights, are supported, among other policies and routines. An auditor should also be able to inspect an organisation, and use the data processing agreement as reference during the inspection.

As depicted in the diagram above, the data agreement with the individual is bound to the top of the hierarchy, i.e. the data controller or organisation .
