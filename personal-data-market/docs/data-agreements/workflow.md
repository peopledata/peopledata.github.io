# Data agreement workflow in SSI

The data agreement lifecycle containing the functionalities envisioned in this project are as given below:




1. **Definition**: The data agreement standards schema is added as a template.

2. **Preparation**: Converting the definition as outlined in the DPIA to an agreement that is legally valid and is published for individuals and Data Using Services..

3. **Negotiation/Capture**: The individual reviews the data agreement offer and once agreed, it is captured as a data agreement receipt by the organisation which is counter signed by the individual.

4. **Proof**: An organisation is able to demonstrate a valid data agreement receipt for performing a data exchange with an individual. This allows an auditor to check and ensure records were in place to process the individual's personal data.

The data agreement receipts generated during an SSI flow will include a reference to the last DPIA that was conducted before the receipt was created. This provides increased auditability and traceability with the organisations involved.

The table below summarises the actors and how they are involved in the different phases of the data agreement lifecycle.
