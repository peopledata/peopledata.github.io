# Data Agreements

There are three types of data agreements:

- A **Data Agreement** exists between organisations(data consumers) and individuals in the use of personal data. This agreement can have any of the legal basis that is outlined as per any data protection regulation.
- A **Data Using Agreement** is a new term introduced here to capture the agreement between two businesses on how data is shared and used, that can be realised as a contract or terms of use.
- A **Data Processing Agreement** is a legally binding contract, either in written or electronic form, entered into between a data processor and a data controller that states the rights and obligations of each party concerning the protection of personal data. The agreement is legally binding in the context of any data protection regulation.
