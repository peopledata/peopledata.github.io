# Background

This project (also referred to as the DA) focuses on building key governance elements in the Peopledata SSI/DID stack that accelerates DID/SSI adoption and aims to remove the regulatory pain points for DID/SSI solution providers within the PeopleData community and beyond by:

1. Standardising data agreement schemas across DID/SSI solution providers.
2. Developing an open source component that automates the process for data agreement handling that can be linked to the issuance and verification of verifiable credentials. This solution is aligned with data regulatory requirements for data exchange and can be plugged into any existing DID/SSI stack workflow.
3. Addressing delegated data agreements or consents for children and elderly citizens.

Throughout this specification we mean requirements pertaining to the GDPR when referring to regulatory compliance, data protection regulation, regulation, data requirements etc, unless otherwise stated.
